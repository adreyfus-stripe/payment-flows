# RocketFuel - A Utility Company built on Stripe Billing

TODO - Describe what this is for

## Getting started with Stripe Billing

RocketFuel uses Stripe Billing's Metered billing functionality. When Pilots need to refuel their 
jetpacks they use a RocketFuel card. Based on the amount of RocketFuel they use in a billing period
they will be billed for that amount. 

In order to do this we have to create a Product and a Plan on Stripe Billing.
